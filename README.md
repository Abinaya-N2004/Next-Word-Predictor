# üß† Next Word Predictor using Markov Chain (N-gram)

This is a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) project built with Python. It predicts the **next word** based on a given word or phrase using a basic **N-gram model** (Markov Chain).

---

## üîß How It Works

1. Reads a text file (`sample.txt`)
2. Cleans and tokenizes the text
3. Builds an n-gram model (default: bigram)
4. Predicts the next word based on user input

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Put your training text in `sample.txt`
2. Run the program:
